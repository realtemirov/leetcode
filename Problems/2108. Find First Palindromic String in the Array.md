# 2108. Find First Palindromic String in the Array
ðŸŸ© Easy

Given an array of strings `words`, return *the first **palindromic** string in the array. If there is no such string, return an **empty string** `""`.*

A string is **palindromic** if it reads the same forward and backward.

## Example 1:
> **Input**: words = ["abc","car","ada","racecar","cool"] \
> **Output**: "ada" \
> **Explanation**: The first string that is palindromic is "ada". \
> Note that "racecar" is also palindromic, but it is not the first.

## Example 2:
> **Input**: words = ["notapalindrome","racecar"] \
> **Output**: "racecar" \
> **Explanation**: The first and only string that is palindromic is "racecar".

## Example 3:
> **Input**: words = ["def","ghi"] \
> **Output**: "" \
> **Explanation**: There are no palindromic strings, so the empty string is returned.

## Constraints:
* `1 <= words.length <= 100`
* `1 <= words[i].length <= 100`
* `words[i]` consists only of lowercase English letters.

## Hint-1
> Iterate through the elements in order. As soon as the current element is a palindrome, return it.

## Hint-2
> To check if an element is a palindrome, can you reverse the string?

## Solution
> **My Solution**
> ```go
> func firstPalindrome(words []string) string {
>     for _, word := range words {
>         if isPalindrome(word) {
>             return word
>         }
>     }
> 
>     return ""
> }
> 
> func isPalindrome(word string) bool {
>     for i:=0; i<len(word); i++ {
>         if word[i] != word[len(word)-1-i] {
>             return false
>         }
>     }
> 
>     return true
> }
> ```
