# 12. Integer to Roman

ðŸŸ§ Medium

Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: `I, V, X, L, C, D` and `M`.

> **Symbol**&emsp;**Value**\
> I &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; 1\
> V &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; 5\
> X &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;10\
> L &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; 50\
> C &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;100\
> D &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;500\
> M&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;1000

For example, `2` is written as `II` in Roman numeral, just two one's added together. `12` is written as `XII`, which is simply `X + II`. The number `27` is written as `XXVII`, which is `XX + V + II`.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not `IIII`. Instead, the number four is written as `IV`. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as `IX`. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

* `I` can be placed before `V` (5) and `X` (10) to make 4 and 9.
* `X` can be placed before `L` (50) and `C` (100) to make 40 and 90.
* `C` can be placed before `D` (500) and `M` (1000) to make 400 and 900.
Given an integer, convert it to a roman numeral.

## Example 1

> **Input**: num = 3 \
> **Output**: "III" \
> **Explanation**: 3 is represented as 3 ones.

## Example 2

> **Input**: num = 58 \
> **Output**: "LVIII" \
> **Explanation**: L = 50, V = 5, III = 3.

## Example 3

> **Input**: num = 1994 \
> **Output**: "MCMXCIV" \
> **Explanation**: M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.

## Constraints

* `1 <= num <= 3999`

## Solution

My Solution

```go
func intToRoman(num int) string {
    nums := []int{1000, 900, 500, 400, 100, 90, 50, 40, 10, 9, 5, 4, 1}
    romans := []string{"M", "CM", "D", "CD", "C", "XC", "L", "XL", "X", "IX", "V", "IV", "I"}
    
    str := strings.Builder{}
    i := 0

    for num > 0 {
        for num >= nums[i] {
            num -= nums[i]
            str.WriteString(romans[i])
        }
        i++
    }
    return str.String()
}
```

Optimal Solution (Greedy Approach)

```go
func intToRoman(num int) string {
    values := []struct {
        val    int
        symbol string
    }{
        {1000, "M"}, {900, "CM"}, {500, "D"}, {400, "CD"},
        {100, "C"}, {90, "XC"}, {50, "L"}, {40, "XL"},
        {10, "X"}, {9, "IX"}, {5, "V"}, {4, "IV"}, {1, "I"},
    }
    
    var result strings.Builder
    
    for _, v := range values {
        for num >= v.val {
            result.WriteString(v.symbol)
            num -= v.val
        }
    }
    
    return result.String()
}
```

### Approach

This solution uses a greedy approach to construct the Roman numeral:

1. Predefined Arrays:
   * nums: Contains all possible values in descending order
   * romans: Contains corresponding Roman numeral symbols
   * Includes both regular symbols (M, D, C...) and subtractive combinations (CM, CD...)

2. String Construction:
   * Uses strings.Builder for efficient string concatenation
   * Processes the number from largest to smallest value
   * Repeatedly subtracts the largest possible value

3. Key Insights:
   * Values are arranged in descending order
   * Special cases (like 4, 9, 40, 90, etc.) are handled as single units
   * Greedy choice always leads to optimal solution

### Complexity Analysis

#### Time Complexity: O(1)

* The input is constrained to [1, 3999]
* Maximum number of iterations is bounded
* Each value can be used at most 3 times (except M)
* strings.Builder operations are O(1)

#### Space Complexity: O(1)

* Fixed-size arrays for values and symbols:
  * nums array: 13 integers
  * romans array: 13 strings
* Output string size is bounded
* No recursive calls or dynamic space

### Why it works

* Greedy Approach is Valid:
  * Roman numerals follow a largest-to-smallest rule
  * Each step reduces the number by the largest possible value
  * No backtracking needed

* Special Cases Handled:
  * Subtractive combinations (IV, IX, XL, etc.) are treated as single units
  * Prevents invalid combinations like IIII for 4

* Complete Coverage:
  * Every integer in range can be uniquely represented
  * All possible combinations are included in the arrays
