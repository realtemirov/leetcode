# 76. Minimum Window Substring
ðŸŸ¥ Hard

Given two strings `s` and `t` of lengths m and n respectively, return the minimum window 
substring of s such that every character in t (including duplicates) is included in the window. If there is no such substring, return the empty string "".

The testcases will be generated such that the answer is unique.

## Example 1:
> **Input**: s = "ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC" \
> **Output**: "BANC" \
> **Explanation**: The minimum window substring "BANC" includes 'A', 'B', and 'C' from string t.

## Example 2:
> **Input**: s = "a", t = "a" \
> **Output**: "a" \
> **Explanation**: The entire string s is the minimum window.

## Example 3:
> **Input**: s = "a", t = "aa" \
> **Output**: "" \
> **Explanation**: Both 'a's from t must be included in the window. \
> Since the largest window of s only has one 'a', return empty string.
 

## Constraints:
* `m == s.length`
* `n == t.length`
* `1 <= m, n <= 10^5`
* `s` and `t` consist of uppercase and lowercase English letters.

## Hint-1
> Use two pointers to create a window of letters in s, which would have all the characters from t.

## Hint-2
> Expand the right pointer until all the characters of t are covered.

## Hint-3
> Once all the characters are covered, move the left pointer and ensure that all the characters are still covered to minimize the subarray size.

## Hint-4
> Continue expanding the right and left pointers until you reach the end of s.

**Follow up**: Could you find an algorithm that runs in `O(m + n)` time?

## Solution

> ```go
> func minWindow(s string, t string) string {

>     tLen := len(t)

>     if sLen == 0 || tLen == 0 || sLen < tLen {
>         return ""
>     }

>     start, end, startPos, count := 0, 0, 0, tLen
>     minLength := 100001

>     sMap := make([]int, 128)
> 
>     for _, char := range t {
>         sMap[char]++

>                 minLength = end-start
>                 startPos = start
>             }

>             if sMap[s[start]] == 0 {
>                 count++

> 
>             sMap[s[start]]++
>             start++
