# 747. Largest Number At Least Twice of Others

You are given an integer array `nums` where the largest integer is **unique**.

Determine whether the largest element in the array is **at least twice** as much as every other number in the array. If it is, return *the **index** of the largest element, or return **-1** otherwise*.

 

## Example 1:

> **Input**: nums = [3,6,1,0] \
> **Output**: 1 \
> **Explanation**: 6 is the largest integer. \
> For every other number in the array x, 6 is at least twice as big as x. \
> The index of value 6 is 1, so we return 1.

## Example 2:

> **Input**: nums = [1,2,3,4] \
> **Output**: -1 \
> **Explanation**: 4 is less than twice the value of 3, so we return -1. \

## Hint
> Scan through the array to find the unique largest element `m`, keeping track of it's index `maxIndex`. Scan through the array again. If we find some `x != m` with `m < 2*x`, we should return `-1`. Otherwise, we should return `maxIndex`.


## Constraints:

* `2 <= nums.length <= 50`
* `0 <= nums[i] <= 100`
* The largest element in `nums` is unique.

## Solution

> **My Solution**
> ```go
> func dominantIndex(nums []int) int {
> 	m := nums[0]
> 	maxIndex := 0
> 	for i, v := range nums {
> 		if v > m {
> 			m = v
> 			maxIndex = i
> 		}
> 	}
> 
> 	for _, v := range nums {
> 		if v != m && v*2 > m {
> 			return -1
> 		}
> 	}
> 
> 	return maxIndex
> }
> ```
