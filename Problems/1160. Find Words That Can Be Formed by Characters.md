# 1160. Find Words That Can Be Formed by Characters
ðŸŸ© Easy

You are given an array of strings `words` and a string `chars`.

A string is **good** if it can be formed by characters from chars (each character can only be used once).

Return *the sum of lengths of all good strings in words.*

## Example 1:
> **Input**: words = ["cat","bt","hat","tree"], chars = "atach" \
> **Output**: 6 \
> **Explanation**: The strings that can be formed are "cat" and "hat" so the answer is 3 + 3 = 6. 

## Example 2:
> **Input**: words = ["hello","world","leetcode"], chars = "welldonehoneyr" \
> **Output**: 10 \
> **Explanation**: The strings that can be formed are "hello" and "world" so the answer is 5 + 5 = 10.

## Constraints:
* `1 <= words.length <= 1000`
* `1 <= words[i].length, chars.length <= 100`
* `words[i]` and `chars` consist of lowercase English letters.

## Hint-1
> Solve the problem for each string in words independently.

## Hint-2
> Now try to think in frequency of letters.

## Hint-3
> Count how many times each character occurs in string `chars`.

## Hint-4
> To form a string using characters from `chars`, the frequency of each character in `chars` must be greater than or equal the frequency of that character in the string to be formed.

## Solution
> **My Solution**
> ```go
> func countCharacters(words []string, chars string) int {
>     m := make([]int,26)
>     sum := 0
>     for _,v := range chars {m[v-'a']++}
> 
>     for _, word := range words {
>         arr := make([]int,26)
>         for _,v := range word {arr[v-'a']++}
>         isPlus := true
>         for i,v := range arr {
>             if m[i] < v {
>                 isPlus = false
>                 break
>             }
> 
>         } 
>         if isPlus {sum+=len(word)}
>     }
>     return sum
> }
> ```
