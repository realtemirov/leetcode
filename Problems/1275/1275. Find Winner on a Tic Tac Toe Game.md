# 1275. Find Winner on a Tic Tac Toe Game

ðŸŸ© Easy

**Tic-tac-toe** is played by two players `A` and `B` on a `3 x 3` grid. The rules of Tic-Tac-Toe are:

* Players take turns placing characters into empty squares `' '`.
* The first player `A` always places `'X'` characters, while the second player `B` always places `'O'` characters.
* `'X'` and `'O'` characters are always placed into empty squares, never on filled ones.
* The game ends when there are **three** of the same (non-empty) character filling any row, column, or diagonal.
* The game also ends if all squares are non-empty.
* No more moves can be played if the game is over.

Given a 2D integer array `moves` where `moves[i] = [rowi, coli]` indicates that the `i^th` move will be played on `grid[rowi][coli]`. return *the winner of the game if it exists (`A` or `B`)*. In case the game ends in a draw return `"Draw"`. If there are still movements to play return `"Pending"`.

You can assume that `moves` is valid (i.e., it follows the rules of **Tic-Tac-Toe**), the grid is initially empty, and `A` will play first.

## Example 1

![tic_tac_toe](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/09/22/xo1-grid.jpg)

> **Input**: [[0,0],[2,0],[1,1],[2,1],[2,2]] \
> **Output**: "A" \
> **Explanation**: A wins, they always play first.

## Example 2

![tic_tac_toe](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/09/22/xo2-grid.jpg)

> **Input**: [[0,0],[1,1],[0,1],[0,2],[1,0],[2,0]] \
> **Output**: "B \
> **Explanation**: B wins

## Constraints

* `1 <= moves.length <= 9`
* `moves[i].length == 2`
* `0 <= rowi, coli <= 2`
* There are no repeated elements on `moves`.
* `moves` follow the rules of tic tac toe

## Hint-1

> It's straightforward to check if A or B won or not, check for each row/column/diag if all the three are the same.

## Hint-2

> Then if no one wins, the game is a draw if the board is full, i.e. moves.length = 9 otherwise is pending.

## Solution

My Solution

```go
func tictactoe(moves [][]int) string {
    grid := [3][3]int{}
    for i, move := range moves {
        grid[move[0]][move[1]] = i&1 + 1
    }

    for i := 0; i < 3; i++ {
        if player := grid[i][i]; player != 0 {
            if (grid[i][0] == grid[i][1] && grid[i][0] == grid[i][2]) ||
                (grid[0][i] == grid[1][i] && grid[0][i] == grid[2][i]) {
                return string(byte('@' + player))
            }
        }
    }

    if player := grid[1][1]; player != 0 {
        if (grid[0][0] == grid[2][2] && grid[0][0] == player) ||
            (grid[2][0] == grid[0][2] && grid[2][0] == player) {
            return string(byte('@' + player))
        }
    }

    if len(moves) != 9 {
        return "Pending"
    }

    return "Draw"
}
```

Optimal solution

```go
func tictactoe(moves [][]int) string {
    // Initialize score arrays
    rows, cols := [3]int{}, [3]int{}
    diagonal, antiDiagonal := 0, 0

    // Iterate over moves
    for i, move := range moves {
        player := 1 // Player A
        if i%2 == 1 {
            player = -1 // Player B
        }
        row, col := move[0], move[1]

        // Update scores
        rows[row] += player
        cols[col] += player
        if row == col {
            diagonal += player
        }
        if row+col == 2 {
            antiDiagonal += player
        }

        // Check for a winner
        if rows[row] == 3 || cols[col] == 3 || diagonal == 3 || antiDiagonal == 3 {
            return "A"
        }
        if rows[row] == -3 || cols[col] == -3 || diagonal == -3 || antiDiagonal == -3 {
            return "B"
        }
    }

    // Determine game state
    if len(moves) == 9 {
        return "Draw"
    }
    return "Pending"
}
```
