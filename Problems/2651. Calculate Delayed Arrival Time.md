# 2651. Calculate Delayed Arrival Time
ðŸŸ© Easy

You are given a positive integer `arrivalTime` denoting the arrival time of a train in hours, and another positive integer `delayedTime` denoting the amount of delay in hours.

Return *the time when the train will arrive at the station*.

Note that the time in this problem is in 24-hours format.

## Example 1:
> **Input**: arrivalTime = 15, delayedTime = 5 \
> **Output**: 20 \
> **Explanation**: Arrival time of the train was 15:00 hours. It is delayed by 5 hours. Now it will reach at 15+5 = 20 (20:00 hours).

## Example 2:
> **Input**: arrivalTime = 13, delayedTime = 11 \
> **Output**: 0 \
> **Explanation**: Arrival time of the train was 13:00 hours. It is delayed by 11 hours. Now it will reach at 13+11=24 (Which is denoted by 00:00 in 24 hours format so return 0).

## Constraints:

* `1 <= arrivaltime < 24`
* `1 <= delayedTime <= 24`

## Hint-1
> Use the modulo operator to handle the case when the arrival time plus the delayed time goes beyond 24 hours.

## Hint-2
> If the arrival time plus the delayed time is greater than or equal to 24, you can also subtract 24 to get the time in the 24-hour format.

## Hint-3
> Use the modulo operator to handle the case when the arrival time plus the delayed time goes beyond 24 hours.

## Hint-4
> If the arrival time plus the delayed time is greater than or equal to 24, you can also subtract 24 to get the time in the 24-hour format.

## Solution
> **My Solution**
> ```go
> func findDelayedArrivalTime(arrivalTime int, delayedTime int) int {
>     return (arrivalTime+delayedTime)%24
> }
> ```
