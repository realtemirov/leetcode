# 746. Min Cost Climbing Stairs
ðŸŸ© Easy

You are given an integer array `cost` where `cost[i]` is the cost of `i^th` step on a staircase. Once you pay the cost, you can either climb one or two steps.

You can either start from the step with index `0`, or the step with index `1`.

Return *the minimum cost to reach the top of the floor*.

## Example 1:
> **Input**: cost = [10,15,20] \
> **Output**: 15 \
> **Explanation**: You will start at index 1. \
> Pay 15 and climb two steps to reach the top. \
> The total cost is 15. 

## Example 2:
> **Input**: cost = [1,100,1,1,1,100,1,1,100,1] \
> **Output**: 6 \
> **Explanation**: You will start at index 0. \
> Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 2. \
> Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 4. \
> Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 6. \
> Pay 1 and climb one step to reach index 7. \
> Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 9. \
> Pay 1 and climb one step to reach the top. \
> The total cost is 6.

## Constraints:
* `2 <= cost.length <= 1000`
* `0 <= cost[i] <= 999`

## Hint-1
> Build an array dp where dp[i] is the minimum cost to climb to the top starting from the ith staircase.

## Hint-2
> Assuming we have n staircase labeled from 0 to n - 1 and assuming the top is n, then dp[n] = 0, marking that if you are at the top, the cost is 0.

## Hint-3
> Now, looping from n - 1 to 0, the dp[i] = cost[i] + min(dp[i + 1], dp[i + 2]). The answer will be the minimum of dp[0] and dp[1]

## Solution
> **My Solution**
> ```go
> func minCostClimbingStairs(cost []int) int {
>     cost = append(cost, 0)
>     for i := len(cost) - 3; i>=0; i-- {
>         cost[i] += min(cost[i+1],cost[i+2])
>     }
> 
>     return min(cost[0], cost[1])
> }
> ```
