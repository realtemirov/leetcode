# 2129. Capitalize the Title

You are given a string `title` consisting of one or more words separated by a single space, where each word consists of English letters. **Capitalize** the string by changing the capitalization of each word such that:

* If the length of the word is `1` or `2` letters, change all letters to lowercase.
* Otherwise, change the first letter to uppercase and the remaining letters to lowercase.

Return *the **capitalized** title*.

## Example 1:
> **Input**: title = "capiTalIze tHe titLe" \
> **Output**: "Capitalize The Title" \
> **Explanation**: \
> Since all the words have a length of at least 3, the first letter of each word is uppercase, and the remaining letters are lowercase.

## Example 2:
> **Input**: title = "First leTTeR of EACH Word" \
> **Output**: "First Letter of Each Word" \
> **Explanation**: \
> The word "of" has length 2, so it is all lowercase.
The remaining words have a length of at least 3, so the first letter of each remaining word is uppercase, and the remaining letters are lowercase.

## Example 3:
> **Input**: title = "i lOve leetcode" \
> **Output**: "i Love Leetcode" \
> **Explanation**: \
> The word "i" has length 1, so it is lowercase. \
> The remaining words have a length of at least 3, so the first letter  of each remaining word is uppercase, and the remaining letters are lowercase.

## Constraints:
* `1 <= title.length <= 100`
* `title` consists of words separated by a single space without any leading or trailing spaces.
* Each word consists of uppercase and lowercase English letters and is **non-empty**.

## Hint-1
> Firstly, try to find all the words present in the string.

## Hint-2
> On the basis of each word's lengths, simulate the process explained in Problem.

## Solution
> **My Solution**
> ```go
> func capitalizeTitle(title string) string {
>     ss := strings.Split(title, " ")
> 
>     s := strings.Builder{}
>     
>     for i, v := range ss {
> 
>         if len(v) <= 2 {
>             s.WriteString(strings.ToLower(v))
>         } else {
>             s.WriteString(strings.Title(strings.ToLower(v)))
>         }
> 
>         if i != len(ss)-1 {
>             s.WriteString(" ")
>         }
>     }
> 
>     return s.String()
> }
> ```
