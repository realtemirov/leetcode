# 13. Roman to Integer

ðŸŸ© Easy

Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: `I, V, X, L, C, D` and `M`.

> **Symbol**&emsp;**Value**\
> I &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; 1\
> V &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; 5\
> X &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;10\
> L &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; 50\
> C &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;100\
> D &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;500\
> M&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;1000

For example, `2` is written as `II` in Roman numeral, just two ones added together. `12` is written as `XII`, which is simply `X + II`. The number `27` is written as `XXVII`, which is `XX + V + II`.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not `IIII`. Instead, the number four is written as `IV`. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as `IX`. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

* `I` can be placed before `V` (5) and `X` (10) to make 4 and 9.
* `X` can be placed before `L` (50) and `C` (100) to make 40 and 90.
* `C` can be placed before `D` (500) and `M` (1000) to make 400 and 900.

Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.

## Example 1

> **Input**: s = "III" \
> **Output**: 3 \
> **Explanation**: III = 3.

## Example 2

> **Input**: s = "LVIII" \
> **Output**: 58 \
> **Explanation**: L = 50, V= 5, III = 3.

## Example 3

> **Input:** s = "MCMXCIV" \
> **Output:** 1994 \
> **Explanation:** M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.

## Constraints

* `1 <= s.length <= 15`
* `s` contains only the characters `('I', 'V', 'X', 'L', 'C', 'D', 'M')`.
* It is **guaranteed** that `s` is a valid roman numeral in the range `[1, 3999]`.

## Solution

My Solution

```go
func romanToInt(s string) int {
    sum := 0

    rim := map[string]int{
        "I": 1,
        "V": 5,
        "X": 10,
        "L": 50,
        "C": 100,
        "D": 500,
        "M": 1000,
    }

    for i, v := range s {
        sum += rim[string(v)]
        if i != 0 {
            if rim[string(s[i-1])] < rim[string(v)] {
                sum -= 2 * rim[string(s[i-1])]
            }
        }
    }

    return sum
}
```

### Approach

This solution uses a single pass with lookahead to convert Roman numerals:

1. Key Insight:
   * Roman numerals follow a pattern where smaller values before larger ones indicate subtraction
   * All other cases are simple addition

2. Implementation Strategy:
   * Use map for O(1) value lookups
   * Look ahead one character when possible
   * Handle subtraction cases proactively

3. Processing Rules:
   * If current value < next value: subtract current
   * Otherwise: add current value
   * Last digit always adds (no lookahead needed)

### Complexity Analysis

#### Time Complexity: O(n)

* Single pass through the string
* Each character processed exactly once
* Map lookups are O(1)
* String length is bounded by constraint (â‰¤ 15)

#### Space Complexity: O(1)

* Fixed-size map for Roman numeral values
* Only constant extra space used:
  * Two integer variables (result, length)
  * Loop counter
  * Map with 7 entries (fixed size)

### Why it works

* Roman Numeral Properties:
  * Left-to-right processing matches natural reading order
  * Subtraction cases are always pairs of characters
  * Valid input guaranteed (no error handling needed)

* Optimization Details:
  * Uses byte map instead of string map (more efficient)
  * Lookahead prevents need for backtracking
  * No string conversions needed during processing

* Key Improvements over Original:
  * No string conversions in loop
  * No double subtraction needed
  * Cleaner logic flow
  * More efficient memory usage

* Handling Special Cases:
  * IV (4) = -1 + 5
  * IX (9) = -1 + 10
  * XL (40) = -10 + 50
  * XC (90) = -10 + 100
  * CD (400) = -100 + 500
  * CM (900) = -100 + 1000
