# 1523. Count Odd Numbers in an Interval Range

ðŸŸ© Easy

Given two non-negative integers `low` and `high`. Return the *count of odd numbers between `low` and `high` (inclusive)*.

## Example 1

> **Input**: low = 3, high = 7 \
> **Output**: 3 \
> **Explanation**: The odd numbers between 3 and 7 are [3,5,7].

## Example 2

> **Input**: low = 8, high = 10 \
> **Output**: 1 \
> **Explanation**: The odd numbers between 8 and 10 are [9].

## Constraints

* `0 <= low <= high <= 10^9`

## Hint-1

> If the range (high - low + 1) is even, the number of even and odd numbers in this range will be the same.

## Hint-2

> If the range (high - low + 1) is odd, the solution will depend on the parity of high and low.

## Solution

My Solution

```go
func countOdds(low int, high int) int {
    return (high + 1)/2 - low / 2
}
```
