# 1637. Widest Vertical Area Between Two Points Containing No Points
ðŸŸ§ Medium

Given `n points` on a 2D plane where `points[i] = [xi, yi]`, Return *the **widest vertical area** between two points such that no points are inside the area*.

A **vertical area** is an area of fixed-width extending infinitely along the y-axis (i.e., infinite height). The **widest vertical area** is the one with the maximum width.

Note that points **on the edge** of a vertical area **are not** considered included in the area.

## Example 1:
![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/19/points3.png)
> **Input**: points = [[8,7],[9,9],[7,4],[9,7]] \
> **Output**: 1 \
> **Explanation**: Both the red and the blue area are optimal.

## Example 2:
> **Input**: points = [[3,1],[9,0],[1,0],[1,4],[5,3],[8,8]] \
> **Output**: 3

## Constraints:
* `n == points.length`
* `2 <= n <= 10^5`
* `points[i].length == 2`
* `0 <= xi, yi <= 10^9`

## Hint-1
> Try sorting the points

## Hint-2
> Think is the y-axis of a point relevant

## Solution
> **My Solution**
> ```go
> func maxWidthOfVerticalArea(points [][]int) int {
> 	arrays := make([]int, len(points))
> 
> 	for i, v := range points {
> 		arrays[i] = v[0]
> 	}
> 	sort.Slice(arrays, func(i, j int) bool {
> 		return arrays[i] < arrays[j]
> 	})
> 
> 	max := 0
> 
> 	for i := 1; i < len(arrays); i++ {
> 		if arrays[i]-arrays[i-1] > max {
> 			max = arrays[i] - arrays[i-1]
> 		}
> 	}
> 
> 	return max
> }
> ```
