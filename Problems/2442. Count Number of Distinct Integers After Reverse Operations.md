# 2442. Count Number of Distinct Integers After Reverse Operations

You are given an array `nums` consisting of **positive** integers.

You have to take each integer in the array, **reverse its digits**, and add it to the end of the array. You should apply this operation to the original integers in `nums`.

Return *the number of **distinct** integers in the final array.*

## Example 1:
> **Input**: nums = [1,13,10,12,31]
> **Output**: 6
> **Explanation**: After including the reverse of each number, the resulting array is [1,13,10,12,31,1,31,1,21,13]. \
The reversed integers that were added to the end of the array are underlined. Note that for the integer 10, after reversing it, it becomes 01 which is just 1. \
The number of distinct integers in this array is 6 (The numbers 1, 10, 12, 13, 21, and 31).

## Example 2:
> **Input**: nums = [2,2,2] \
> **Output**: 1 \
> **Explanation**: After including the reverse of each number, the resulting array is [2,2,2,2,2,2]. \
The number of distinct integers in this array is 1 (The number 2).

## Constraints:
> * <code>1 <= nums.length <= 10<sup>5</sup></code>
> * <code>1 <= nums[i] <= 10<sup>6</sup></code>

## Hint-1
> What data structure allows us to insert numbers and find the number of distinct numbers in it?

## Hint-2
> Try using a set, insert all the numbers and their reverse into it, and return its size.


## Solution
> **My Solution**
> ```go
> func countDistinctIntegers(nums []int) int {
> 	numbers := make(map[int]bool)
> 
> 	for i := range nums {
> 		numbers[nums[i]]=true
> 		numbers[reverse(nums[i])]=true
> 	}
> 	return len(numbers)
> }
> func reverse(num int) int {
> 	sum := 0
> 	for num != 0 {
> 		sum = sum*10 + num%10
> 		num/=10
> 	}
> 	return sum
> }
> ```
