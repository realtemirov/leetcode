# 860. Lemonade Change

ðŸŸ© Easy

At a lemonade stand, each lemonade costs `$5`. Customers are standing in a queue to buy from you and order one at a time (in the order specified by bills). Each customer will only buy one lemonade and pay with either a `$5`, `$10`, or `$20` bill. You must provide the correct change to each customer so that the net transaction is that the customer pays `$5`.

Note that you do not have any change in hand at first.

Given an integer array `bills` where `bills[i]` is the bill the `i^th` customer pays, return `true` *if you can provide every customer with the correct change, or `false` otherwise.*

## Example 1

> **Input**: bills = [5,5,5,10,20] \
> **Output**: true \
> **Explanation**: From the first 3 customers, we collect three $5 bills in order. \
> From the fourth customer, we collect a $10 bill and give back a $5. \
> From the fifth customer, we give a $10 bill and a $5 bill. \
> Since all customers got correct change, we output true.

## Example 2

> **Input**: bills = [5,5,10,10,20] \
> **Output**: false \
> **Explanation**: From the first two customers in order, we collect two $5 bills. \
> For the next two customers in order, we collect a $10 bill and give back a $5 bill. \
> For the last customer, we can not give the change of $15 back because we only have two $10 bills. \
> Since not every customer received the correct change, the answer is false.

## Constraints

* `1 <= bills.length <= 105`
* `bills[i]` is either `5`, `10`, or `20.`

## Solution

My Solution

```go
func lemonadeChange(bills []int) bool {
    m := map[int]int{}

    for _, v := range bills {
        m[v]++
        if v == 10 {
            if m[5] > 0 {
                m[5]--
            } else {
                return false
            }
        } else if v == 20 {
            if m[10] >= 1 && m[5] >= 1 {
                m[10]--
                m[5]--
            } else if m[5]>=3 {
                m[5]-=3
            } else {
                return false
            }
        }
    }

    return true
}
```

Optimal solution

```go
func lemonadeChange(bills []int) bool {
    five, ten := 0, 0

    for _, bill := range bills {
        if bill == 5 {
            five++
        } else if bill == 10 {
            if five == 0 {
                return false
            }
            five--
            ten++
        } else if bill == 20 {
            if ten > 0 && five > 0 {
                ten--
                five--
            } else if five >= 3 {
                five -= 3
            } else {
                return false
            }
        }
    }

    return true
}
```
