# 1436. Destination City
ðŸŸ© Easy

You are given the array `paths`, where `paths[i] = [cityAi, cityBi]` means there exists a direct path going from `cityAi` to `cityBi`. Return *the destination city, that is, the city without any path outgoing to another city*.

It is guaranteed that the graph of paths forms a line without any loop, therefore, there will be exactly one destination city.

## Example 1:
> **Input**: paths = [["London","New York"],["New York","Lima"],["Lima","Sao Paulo"]] \
> **Output**: "Sao Paulo" \
> **Explanation**: Starting at "London" city you will reach "Sao Paulo" city which is the destination city. Your trip consist of: "London" -> "New York" -> "Lima" -> "Sao Paulo".

## Example 2:
> **Input**: paths = [["B","C"],["D","B"],["C","A"]] \
> **Output**: "A" \
> **Explanation**: All possible trips are:  \
"D" -> "B" -> "C" -> "A".  \
"B" -> "C" -> "A". \
"C" -> "A". \
"A". \
Clearly the destination city is "A".

## Example 3:
> **Input**: paths = [["A","Z"]] \
> **Output**: "Z"

## Constraints:
* `1 <= paths.length <= 100`
* `paths[i].length == 2`
* `1 <= cityAi.length, cityBi.length <= 10`
* `cityAi != cityBi`
* All strings consist of lowercase and uppercase English letters and the space character.

## Hint-1
> Start in any city and use the path to move to the next city.

## Hint-2
> Eventually, you will reach a city with no path outgoing, this is the destination city.

## Solution
> **My Solution**
> ```go
> func destCity(paths [][]string) string {
>     cities := map[string]bool{}
> 
>     for _, path := range paths {
>         cities[path[0]]=true
>     }
> 
>     for _, path := range paths {
>         if !cities[path[1]]{
>             return path[1]
>         }
>     }
> 
>     return ""
> }
> ```
