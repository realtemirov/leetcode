# 1491. Average Salary Excluding the Minimum and Maximum Salary

ðŸŸ© Easy

You are given an array of **unique** integers `salary` where `salary[i]` is the salary of the `i^th` employee.

Return *the average salary of employees excluding the minimum and maximum salary*. Answers within `10^-5` of the actual answer will be accepted.

## Example 1

> **Input**: salary = [4000,3000,1000,2000] \
> **Output**: 2500.00000 \
> **Explanation**: Minimum salary and maximum salary are 1000 and 4000 respectively.
> Average salary excluding minimum and maximum salary is (2000+3000) / 2 = 2500

## Example 2

> **Input**: salary = [1000,2000,3000] \
> **Output**: 2000.00000 \
> **Explanation**: Minimum salary and maximum salary are 1000 and 3000 respectively.
> Average salary excluding minimum and maximum salary is (2000) / 1 = 2000

## Constraints

* `3 <= salary.length <= 100`
* `1000 <= salary[i] <= 10^6`
* All the integers of `salary` are **unique**.

## Hint-1

> Get the total sum and subtract the minimum and maximum value in the array. Finally divide the result by n - 2.

## Solution

My Solution

```go
func average(salary []int) float64 {
    var maxNum, minNum = salary[0], salary[0]
    var sumArr int

    for _, val := range salary {
        sumArr += val

        if val > maxNum {
            maxNum = val
        }

        if val < minNum {
            minNum = val
        }
    }

    return float64(sumArr-minNum-maxNum) / float64(len(salary)-2)
}
```
