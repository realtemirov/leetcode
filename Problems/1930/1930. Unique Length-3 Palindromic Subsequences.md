# 1930. Unique Length-3 Palindromic Subsequences

ðŸŸ§ Medium

Given a string `s`, return *the number of **unique palindromes of length three** that are a **subsequence** of `s`*.

Note that even if there are multiple ways to obtain the same subsequence, it is still only counted **once**.

A **palindrome** is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards.

A **subsequence** of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

* For example, `"ace"` is a subsequence of `"abcde".`

## Example 1

> **Input**: s = "aabca" \
> **Output**: 3s \
> **Explanation**: The 3 palindromic subsequences of length 3 are:
>
> * "aba" (subsequence of "aabca")
> * "aaa" (subsequence of "aabca")
> * "aca" (subsequence of "aabca")

## Example 2

> **Input**: s = "bbcbaba" \
> **Output**: 4 \
> **Explanation**: The 4 palindromic subsequences of length 3 are:
>
> * "bbb" (subsequence of "bbcbaba")
> * "bcb" (subsequence of "bbcbaba")
> * "bab" (subsequence of "bbcbaba")
> * "aba" (subsequence of "bbcbaba")

## Constraints

* `3 <= s.length <= 10^5`
* `s` consists of only lowercase English letters.

## Hint 1

> What is the maximum number of length-3 palindromic strings?

## Hint 2

> How can we keep track of the characters that appeared to the left of a given position?

## Solution

My Solution

```go
func countPalindromicSubsequence(s string) int {
    firstIdx := make(map[byte]int, len(s))
    lastIdx := make(map[byte]int, len(s))

    for i:=0; i<len(s); i++{
        if _, ok := firstIdx[s[i]]; !ok {
            firstIdx[s[i]]=i
        }

        lastIdx[s[i]]=i
    }

    count := 0

    for char, start := range firstIdx {
        end := lastIdx[char]
        if start < end {
            uniqueChars := make(map[byte]bool, end-start)
            for i:=start+1; i<end; i++ {
                uniqueChars[s[i]]=true
            }

            count+=len(uniqueChars)
        }
    }

    return count
}
```
