# 206. Reverse Linked List

ðŸŸ© Easy

Given the `head` of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the _reversed list_.

## Example 1

![list](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/19/rev1ex1.jpg)

> **Input**: head = [1,2,3,4,5] \
> **Output**: [5,4,3,2,1]

## Example 2

![list](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/19/rev1ex2.jpg)

> **Input**: head = [1,2] \
> **Output**: [2,1]

## Example 3

> **Input**: head = [] \
> **Output**: []

## Constraints

* The number of nodes in the list is the range `[0, 5000]`.
* `-5000 <= Node.val <= 5000`

**Follow up**: A linked list can be reversed either iteratively or recursively. Could you implement both?

## Solution

My Solution (Iterative)

```go
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * type ListNode struct {
 *     Val int
 *     Next *ListNode
 * }
 */
func reverseList(head *ListNode) *ListNode {
    var (
        prev, curr, next *ListNode
    )
    curr = head

    for curr != nil {
        next = curr.Next
        curr.Next = prev
        prev = curr
        curr = next
    }

    return prev
}
```

Optimal Solution (Recursive)

```go
func reverseList(head *ListNode) *ListNode {
    // Base case: empty list or single node
    if head == nil || head.Next == nil {
        return head
    }
    
    // Recursively reverse the rest of the list
    rest := reverseList(head.Next)
    
    // Fix the connections
    head.Next.Next = head
    head.Next = nil
    
    return rest
}
```

### Approach Analysis

This classic problem can be solved in two main ways:

1. Iterative Approach (Your Solution):
   * Uses three pointers for explicit control
   * Reverses links one by one
   * Very space efficient
   * Great for interviews

2. Recursive Approach (Optimal):
   * Elegant divide-and-conquer
   * Reverses from back to front
   * More mathematical
   * Cleaner code

### Visualization of Both Approaches

#### Iterative Process

```text
Initial: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5
Step 1:  nil <- 1    2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5
Step 2:  nil <- 1 <- 2    3 -> 4 -> 5
Final:  nil <- 1 <- 2 <- 3 <- 4 <- 5
```

#### Recursive Process

```text
Initial Call Stack:
reverseList(1->2->3->4->5)
  reverseList(2->3->4->5)
    reverseList(3->4->5)
      reverseList(4->5)
        reverseList(5)
          return 5

Unwinding:
5 is new head
4->5->4 becomes 5->4
3->4 becomes 4->3
2->3 becomes 3->2
1->2 becomes 2->1
```

### Complexity Analysis

#### Iterative Solution

* Time: O(n)
  * Single pass through list
  * Constant work per node
  * No repeated work

* Space: O(1)
  * Only three pointers
  * Constant extra space
  * True in-place reversal

#### Recursive Solution

* Time: O(n)
  * Visits each node once
  * Constant work per node
  * Same as iterative

* Space: O(n)
  * Recursive call stack
  * One frame per node
  * Not truly in-place

### Why Both Solutions Work

1. Iterative Approach:
   * Maintains clear invariants
   * Never loses track of nodes
   * Very mechanical process
   * Easy to visualize

2. Recursive Approach:
   * Assumes subproblem solved
   * Works backwards elegantly
   * More mathematical thinking
   * Cleaner implementation

### When to Use Each

1. Choose Iterative When:
   * Memory is constrained
   * Large input expected
   * Maximum performance needed
   * Interview setting

2. Choose Recursive When:
   * Code clarity priority
   * Small to medium input
   * Teaching/learning
   * Quick implementation needed

### Common Patterns & Applications

1. Similar Problems:
   * Reverse Linked List II
   * Palindrome Linked List
   * Swap Nodes in Pairs

2. Key Techniques:
   * Multiple pointer manipulation
   * Recursion on linked structure
   * Link reversal
   * Stack usage (implicit/explicit)

### Interview Tips

1. Discuss Both Approaches:
   * Mention space trade-offs
   * Explain time complexity
   * Discuss pros and cons
   * Show knowledge depth

2. Common Pitfalls:
   * Not saving next pointer
   * Stack overflow in recursion
   * Infinite loops
   * Lost references

3. Testing Strategy:
   * Empty list
   * Single node
   * Two nodes
   * General case
   * Check all links
