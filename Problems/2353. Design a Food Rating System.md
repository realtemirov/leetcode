# 2353. Design a Food Rating System
ðŸŸ§ Medium

Design a food rating system that can do the following:

* **Modify** the rating of a food item listed in the system.
* Return the highest-rated food item for a type of cuisine in the system.

Implement the `FoodRatings` class:

* `FoodRatings(String[] foods, String[] cuisines, int[] ratings)` Initializes the system. The food items are described by `foods`, `cuisines` and `ratings`, all of which have a length of `n`.
    * foods[i] is the name of the ith food,
    * cuisines[i] is the type of cuisine of the ith food, and
    * ratings[i] is the initial rating of the ith food.

* `void changeRating(String food, int newRating)` Changes the rating of the food item with the name `food`.

* `String highestRated(String cuisine)` Returns the name of the food item that has the highest rating for the given type of `cuisine`. If there is a tie, return the item with the **lexicographically smaller** name.

Note that a string `x` is lexicographically smaller than string `y` if `x` comes before `y` in dictionary order, that is, either `x` is a prefix of `y`, or if `i` is the first position such that `x[i] != y[i]`, then `x[i]` comes before `y[i]` in alphabetic order.

## Example 1:
* **Input**
["FoodRatings", "highestRated", "highestRated", "changeRating", "highestRated", "changeRating", "highestRated"]
[[["kimchi", "miso", "sushi", "moussaka", "ramen", "bulgogi"], ["korean", "japanese", "japanese", "greek", "japanese", "korean"], [9, 12, 8, 15, 14, 7]], ["korean"], ["japanese"], ["sushi", 16], ["japanese"], ["ramen", 16], ["japanese"]]
* **Output**
[null, "kimchi", "ramen", null, "sushi", null, "ramen"]
* **Explanation** \
FoodRatings foodRatings = new FoodRatings(["kimchi", "miso", "sushi", "moussaka", "ramen", "bulgogi"], ["korean", "japanese", "japanese", "greek", "japanese", "korean"], [9, 12, 8, 15, 14, 7]); \
\
foodRatings.highestRated("korean"); // return "kimchi" \
// "kimchi" is the highest rated korean food with a rating of 9. \
\
foodRatings.highestRated("japanese"); // return "ramen" \
// "ramen" is the highest rated japanese food with a rating of 14. \
\
foodRatings.changeRating("sushi", 16); // "sushi" now has a rating of 16. \
\
foodRatings.highestRated("japanese"); // return "sushi" \
// "sushi" is the highest rated japanese food with a rating of 16. \
\
foodRatings.changeRating("ramen", 16); // "ramen" now has a rating of 16. \
\
foodRatings.highestRated("japanese"); // return "ramen" \
// Both "sushi" and "ramen" have a rating of 16. \
// However, "ramen" is lexicographically smaller than "sushi".


## Constraints:
* `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^4`
* `n == foods.length == cuisines.length == ratings.length`
* `1 <= foods[i].length, cuisines[i].length <= 10`
* `foods[i], cuisines[i]` consist of lowercase English letters.
* `1 <= ratings[i] <= 10^8`
* All the strings in `foods` are **distinct**.
* `food` will be the name of a food item in the system across all calls to `changeRating`.
* `cuisine` will be a type of cuisine of **at least one** food item in the system across all calls to `highestRated`.
* At most `2 * 10^4` calls **in total** will be made to `changeRating` and `highestRated`.

## Hint-1
> The key to solving this problem is to properly store the data using the right data structures.

## Hint-2
> Firstly, a hash table is needed to efficiently map each food item to its cuisine and current rating.

## Hint-3
> In addition, another hash table is needed to map cuisines to foods within each cuisine stored in an ordered set according to their ratings.
