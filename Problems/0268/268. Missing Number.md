# 268. Missing Number

ğŸŸ© Easy

Given an array `nums` containing `n` distinct numbers in the range `[0, n]`, return *the only number in the range that is missing from the array*.

## Example 1

> **Input**: nums = [3,0,1] \
> **Output**: 2 \
> **Explanation**: n = 3 since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,3]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.

## Example 2

> **Input**: nums = [0,1] \
> **Output**: 2 \
> **Explanation**: n = 2 since there are 2 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,2]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.

## Example 3

> **Input**: nums = [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1] \
> **Output**: 8 \
> **Explanation**: n = 9 since there are 9 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,9]. 8 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.

## Constraints

* `n == nums.length`
* `1 <= n <= 10^4`
* `0 <= nums[i] <= n`
* All the numbers of `nums` are *unique*.

**Follow up**: Could you implement a solution using only `O(1)` extra space complexity and `O(n)` runtime complexity?

## Solution

My Solution (Gauss Formula)

```go
func missingNumber(nums []int) int {
    n := len(nums)

    sum := n*(n+1)/2

    for _, num := range nums {
        sum -= num
    }

    return sum
}
```

Optimal Solution 1 (XOR)

```go
func missingNumber(nums []int) int {
    result := len(nums)
    
    // XOR all numbers from 0 to n with array elements
    for i := 0; i < len(nums); i++ {
        result ^= i ^ nums[i]
    }
    
    return result
}
```

Optimal Solution 2 (Cyclic Sort)

```go
func missingNumber(nums []int) int {
    i := 0
    n := len(nums)
    
    // Place each number in its correct position
    for i < n {
        pos := nums[i]
        if pos < n && pos != i {
            nums[i], nums[pos] = nums[pos], nums[i]
        } else {
            i++
        }
    }
    
    // Find the missing number
    for i := 0; i < n; i++ {
        if nums[i] != i {
            return i
        }
    }
    
    return n
}
```

### Visualization of Approaches

#### Gauss Formula Process (Your Solution)

```text
Input: [3,0,1]
n = 3

Step 1: Expected sum = n*(n+1)/2
                    = 3*(3+1)/2
                    = 3*4/2
                    = 6

Step 2: Actual sum = 3 + 0 + 1 = 4

Step 3: Missing = Expected - Actual
                = 6 - 4
                = 2
```

#### XOR Process

```text
Input: [3,0,1]
n = 3

Step 1: result = 3 (length)
Step 2: result = 3 ^ 0 ^ 3
Step 3: result = 3 ^ 1 ^ 0
Step 4: result = 3 ^ 2 ^ 1
Final: result = 2
```

#### Cyclic Sort Process

```text
Input: [3,0,1]

Step 1: [3,0,1] â†’ swap 3 and 1 â†’ [1,0,3]
Step 2: [1,0,3] â†’ swap 1 and 0 â†’ [0,1,3]
Step 3: [0,1,3] â†’ array sorted

Check indices:
index 0: nums[0] = 0 
index 1: nums[1] = 1 
index 2: nums[2] = 3 
Missing: 2
```
