# 344. Reverse String
ðŸŸ© Easy

Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters `s`.

You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with `O(1)` extra memory.

## Example 1:

> **Input**: s = ["h","e","l","l","o"] \
> **Output**: ["o","l","l","e","h"]

## Example 2:

> **Input**: s = ["H","a","n","n","a","h"] \
> **Output**: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]
 

## Constraints:
* <code>1 <= s.length <= 10<sup>5</sup></code>`
* `s[i] is a printable ascii character.`

## Hint-1
> The entire logic for reversing a string is based on using the opposite directional two-pointer approach!

## Solution
> **My Solution**
> ```go
> func reverseString(s []byte) {
> 	n := len(s)
> 	for i := 0; i < n/2; i++ {
> 		s[i], s[n-1-i] = s[n-1-i], s[i]
> 	}
> }
> ```
