# 3005. Count Elements With Maximum Frequency
ðŸŸ© Easy

You are given an array `nums` consisting of **positive** integers.

Return *the **total frequencies** of elements in `nums` such that those elements all have the **maximum** frequency.*

The **frequency** of an element is the number of occurrences of that element in the array.

## Example 1:
> **Input**: nums = [1,2,2,3,1,4] \
> **Output**: 4 \
> **Explanation**: The elements 1 and 2 have a frequency of 2 which is the maximum frequency in the array. \
> So the number of elements in the array with maximum frequency is 4.

## Example 2:
> **Input**: nums = [1,2,3,4,5] \
> **Output**: 5 \
> **Explanation**: All elements of the array have a frequency of 1 which is the maximum. \
> So the number of elements in the array with maximum frequency is 5.

## Constraints:
> `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
> `1 <= nums[i] <= 100`

## Hint-1
> Find frequencies of all elements of the array.

## Hint-2
> Find the elements that have the maximum frequencies and count their total occurrences.

## Solution
> **My Solution**
> ```go
> func maxFrequencyElements(nums []int) int {
>     max := 0
>     sum := 0
>     m := map[int]int{}
> 
>     for _, num := range nums {
>         m[num]++
>         if m[num] > max {
>             max = m[num]
>         }
>     }
> 
>     for _, val := range m {
>         if val == max {
>             sum+=val
>         }
>     }
> 
>     return sum
> }
> ```
