# 11. Container With Most Water

 Medium

You are given an integer array `height` of length `n`. There are `n` vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the `i^th` line are `(i, 0)` and `(i, height[i])`.

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return *the maximum amount of water a container can store.*

**Notice** that you may not slant the container.

## Example 1

![image](https://s3-lc-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2018/07/17/question_11.jpg)
> **Input**: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7] \
> **Output**: 49 \
> **Explanation**: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.

## Example 2

> **Input**: height = [1,1] \
> **Output**: 1

## Constraints

* `n == height.length`
* `2 <= n <= 10^5`
* `0 <= height[i] <= 10^4`

## Solution

My Solution

```go
func maxArea(h []int) int {
    area := 0

    l, r :=0, len(h)-1
    for l <= r {
        area = max(area,(r-l)*min(h[l],h[r]))
        if h[l] < h[r] {
            l++
        } else {
            r--
        }
    }

    return area
}
```

Optimal Solution (Two Pointer Approach)

```go
func maxArea(height []int) int {
    maxArea, left, right := 0, 0, len(height)-1
    
    for left < right {
        width := right - left
        h := min(height[left], height[right])
        maxArea = max(maxArea, width*h)
        
        if height[left] < height[right] {
            left++
        } else {
            right--
        }
    }
    
    return maxArea
}
```

### Approach

The Two Pointer technique is used to solve this problem efficiently:

1. Initialize two pointers:
   * Left pointer at the start (index 0)
   * Right pointer at the end (index n-1)

2. Calculate area at each step:
   * Width = right - left (distance between lines)
   * Height = min(height[left], height[right])
   * Current area = width * height

3. Update maximum area if current area is larger

4. Move pointers strategically:
   * If height[left] < height[right], move left pointer right
   * If height[right] <= height[left], move right pointer left
   * This ensures we always explore the possibility of finding a larger area

### Complexity Analysis

#### Time Complexity: O(n)

* We traverse the array exactly once
* Each element is visited at most once by either left or right pointer
* All operations inside the loop (min, max) are O(1)

#### Space Complexity: O(1)

* We only use three variables regardless of input size:
  * maxArea - to store the maximum area
  * left - left pointer
  * right - right pointer

### Why it works

* Uses two pointers to track potential container boundaries

* Always moves the pointer with smaller height inward

* Area is limited by the smaller height, so moving the taller pointer would never give a better result

* Efficiently finds the maximum area by considering all possible optimal container configurations
